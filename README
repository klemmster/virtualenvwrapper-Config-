Finds the correct project in a Project directory
Allows for easy project organisation, by company for example

~/Projects
    /Company1
        /Project1
        /Project2
    /Company2
        /Project3
        /Project4

Virtualenv names have to be the same as the projects names, there should
be no duplicates
